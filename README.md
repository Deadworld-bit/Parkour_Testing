# Welcome to Parkour_Testing repository
## This repo stores unity projects. You will find in this repo the following stuff
* Parkour_Testing is a dynamic parkour game developed using the Unity game engine.
* The game features an advanced system that detects obstacles and performs different parkour actions based on the height of the detected obstacles. This includes parkour jumps, vaulting, climbing, and various other custom actions.
* The game automatically rotates characters toward obstacles and executes appropriate actions like vaulting and climbing. It also detects ledges, enabling ledge jumps, ledge movements, and more intricate parkour maneuvers.
* Assets and models from the Unity Asset Store are used to enrich the visual experience.

## Future Update:
* Add more climb up action and slide action.
* Add shimmy action on edge.
